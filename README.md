This is a repository to store and visualize small ideas. I have found that I come
up with many small ideas and I do not know if they will lead to anything, if they're
valuable, or where they fit in with my other thoughts. This repository 
allows me to create a database of these ideas and understand how they are semantically related through a spatial map. For right now the visualization/graph is not that useful but in the future I hope this visualization helps connect ideas and allows a user to query the database for related ideas.
